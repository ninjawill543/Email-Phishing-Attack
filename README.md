## Introduction

This guide is based off a project I did during my first year of computer science, where I had to install and setup an email phishing campaign.

## Requirements 

- One domain name
- At least one server, in my examples I used two to separate the different applications (For the email server, make sure your provider allows the use of all ports, including the port 25 which is crucial. I recommend **Contabo**, as providers such as ovh or digital ocean do not allow the use of such ports.)
- You may use the OS of your choosing however for this example I will be using Ubuntu 22.04
